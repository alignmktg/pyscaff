## Next Work Session Assignment

**MVID v1.0 Milestone** (Due: 2025-10-17, 17.5 hours total)

### ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE START - NO BLOCKERS

Start these **IN PARALLEL** using multiple agents (no dependency risks):

**Batch 1 (Parallel - 6.5h total):**
```bash
# Launch 3 agents in SINGLE message with 3 Task tool calls:
1. Agent: #36 WP-021 Remove /workflows/new (0.5h)
2. Agent: #31 WP-016 LiteLLM Integration (2h)
3. Agent: #34 WP-019 Markdown Rendering (2h)
4. Agent: #32 WP-017 Approval Executor (4h) - LONGEST, start first
```

**Why parallel-safe:**
- WP-021: Frontend cleanup (deletes files)
- WP-016: Backend AI abstraction (app/agent/)
- WP-019: Frontend component (components/ui/markdown-renderer.tsx)
- WP-017: Backend executor (app/executors/approval.py)
- **Zero file conflicts, different modules**

### ðŸ“‹ Sequential After Batch 1

**WP-020: Fix Approval Frontend** (1h) - BLOCKED by WP-017
- Depends on approval executor existing
- Updates frontend to call `/v1/executions/:id/resume`

**WP-018: Auth (JWT + Password Reset)** (6h) - Can start anytime
- Backend: app/routers/auth.py
- Frontend: app/auth/
- **Updated scope:** SOTA password reset with Resend (OWASP 2024)
  - 20-minute token expiry, CSPRNG, single-use
  - Rate limiting: 3 attempts/hour per email

**WP-022: E2E Test** (2h) - BLOCKED by ALL above
- Validates full flow: login â†’ workflow â†’ form â†’ AI â†’ approval â†’ complete

### ðŸ“Š Current Status

**Open Issues:** 7 (#31-37)
**Closed Issues:** 20 (zombie issues #4-27 cleaned up)

**Milestone Progress:**
- âœ… Governance setup complete (slash commands, updated CLAUDE.md)
- âœ… Zombie issues closed
- âœ… WP-018 updated with SOTA password reset (Resend, OWASP 2024)
- ðŸ”„ Ready to start implementation

### ðŸŽ¯ Execution Instructions

**Session Start:**
```bash
/start-session  # Auto-loads PRD, SESSION-HANDOFF, GitHub issues
```

**Launch Parallel Work (COPY THIS COMMAND):**
Send **ONE message** with **FOUR Task tool calls** to launch agents in parallel:
- Task 1: backend-architect agent â†’ WP-021 (cleanup)
- Task 2: python-pro agent â†’ WP-016 (LiteLLM)
- Task 3: frontend-developer agent â†’ WP-019 (markdown)
- Task 4: python-pro agent â†’ WP-017 (approval executor)

**After Batch 1 Complete:**
- Sequential: WP-020 (1h, blocked by WP-017)
- Parallel-safe: WP-018 (6h, auth - no blockers)
- Final: WP-022 (2h, E2E test - needs everything)

**Before Each Work Package:**
Run `/verify-prd` to validate scope alignment.

## Admonitions

- DO NOT merge PRs unless specifically instructed - the user reviews ALL code before merge.
- DO NOT deviate from Sprint 1 work packages (#3-#24) - resist any "wouldn't it be cool if" features, tooling rabbit holes, or architecture gold-plating that delays shipping the Minimum Viable for Internal Dogfooding (MVID) product per spec.
- DO ensure all sub-agents comment on GitHub issues with start/progress/completion updates (minimum 3 comments per WP).
