Usage: $0 "<idea or request>"

The Gatekeeper evaluates your idea against:
- Industry best practices
- Current MVP scope
- Work package discipline (2-6 hour batches)
- BDD/TDD requirements
- Project constitution principles

Examples:
  $0 "Should we add OAuth login?"
  $0 "Can we refactor the entire auth system?"
  $0 "Let's add real-time collaboration"

    exit 1

# Core evaluation criteria
cat << 'EVALUATION'
üéØ EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. ‚è±Ô∏è  WORK PACKAGE SIZE
   ‚úì Can this be completed in 2-6 hours?
   ‚úì Single atomic commit possible?
   ‚úì Clear definition of done?

2. üé™ MVP FOCUS
   ‚úì Is this essential for MVP?
   ‚úì Does it serve current users?
   ‚úì Can we ship without it?

3. üß™ TEST DISCIPLINE
   ‚úì Can we write tests first?
   ‚úì Is 80% coverage achievable?
   ‚úì Clear acceptance criteria?

4. üèóÔ∏è  TECHNICAL DEBT
   ‚úì Does this add unnecessary complexity?
   ‚úì Are we solving real vs imagined problems?
   ‚úì Is there a simpler solution?

5. üìã PROJECT CONSTITUTION
   ‚úì Safe-by-default approach?
   ‚úì Transparent and observable?
   ‚úì Incremental delivery possible?

# Decision matrix
cat << 'MATRIX'
PROCEED IF:
‚úÖ Fits in single work package (2-6 hours)
‚úÖ Has clear business value for MVP
‚úÖ Can be tested with BDD/TDD
‚úÖ Doesn't violate constitution
‚úÖ Has GitHub issue created

REJECT IF:
‚ùå "Nice to have" not "need to have"
‚ùå Requires multiple work packages
‚ùå Adds complexity without proven need
‚ùå Violates single-commit principle
‚ùå No clear acceptance criteria

DEFER IF:
‚è∏Ô∏è  Good idea but not MVP critical
‚è∏Ô∏è  Requires significant architecture changes
‚è∏Ô∏è  Dependencies not ready
‚è∏Ô∏è  Better solution might emerge
