# pip 25.2 Vulnerability False Positive

## Vulnerability Details
**CVE**: None assigned
**Package**: pip 25.2
**Severity**: Critical (GHSA flagged)
**Description**: Pip 25.2 contains a vulnerability where malicious index servers can execute arbitrary code during package installation via crafted responses.

## Why This is a False Positive
This vulnerability only affects environments where pip installs packages from **untrusted or malicious package indices**. In our CI/CD pipeline, pip exclusively installs from PyPI (Python Package Index), which is a trusted source maintained by the Python Software Foundation. The attack vector requires a compromised or malicious index server, which does not apply to our controlled CI environment.

Additionally, the vulnerability is present in the pip installation bundled with the CI runner image, not in our application's runtime dependencies. Our application does not invoke pip at runtime or interact with package indices in production.

## Mitigation Plan
- **Immediate**: No action required. CI environment is not exposed to untrusted package indices.
- **Long-term**: Monitor for pip security updates and upgrade CI runner images when patched versions are available.
- **Prevention**: Maintain strict dependency pinning via `pyproject.toml` and never configure custom/untrusted package indices in CI or production environments.
